chromeos-libcros (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Use dh(1) and dh-chromeos.
  * Fix build-dependencies.
  * Build-depend on libchrome-dev and libchromeos-dev rather than looking
    directly in ../common and ../third_party/chrome/files.
  * Use cross-tools from environment if set.
  * Drop -m32, but link with -fPIC.
  * Use packaged synaptics library rather than looking directly in
    ../third_party/synaptics.
